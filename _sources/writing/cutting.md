# Cutting papers to length

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In order to write well, you must be willing to sacrifice your soldiers. Some beloved words will get cut from the title, some beloved sentences from the abstract, some beloved paragraphs from the intro, and sometimes entire sections that just don&#39;t belong in this particular paper.</p>&mdash; Zachary Lipton (@zacharylipton) <a href="https://twitter.com/zacharylipton/status/1435617080179560449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 8, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Concise writing is important for clarity and most CS venues include length limits in pages. When you're writing at first, write as long as it takes to tell the complete story. Then, make it shorter in the revision stage.  This page is a growing list of things to look for when you're cutting a paper to length.  

## General

Focus on making the writing more concise, over cutting content.
<!-- most of it will be sentence-level fixes over content cutting -->
- look for lines with less than 75% full and focus on those paragraphs
- For long, complicated sentences a big rephrase can work, one tip is to copy the sentence, comment out one copy, as is, and then try to change it to be shorter

## Writing  Strategies

Active & direct writing is more concise:
- use phrases with active verbs are almost always fewer words
- avoid phrases like “in particular”, “however”, “additionally” type intros. they don’t add clarity but do take up space
- sentences with "also" that reference to previous parts of a paragraph can be sometimes combined
- if a long phrase occurs many times, consider introducing a new term that - captures the whole thing  
- credit other’s work with a crisp sentence that summarizes their work and an intext citation instead of “as shown by author” or “author showed” etc

## Swaps to make

- change phrases like “not only ... but also” to ” ... and”
- change phrases of the “are verb-ing” to "verb" where possible
- check for “of”  that can be removed eg “representation of a group” to “group representation”

## Formatting Tips

- use inline numbered lists (see enumitem package);
- don't use heading unless 3+ sentences
