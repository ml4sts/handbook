# Reading Research

Reading research papers is an essential skill in research. To learn this
 skill, start with reading [How to Read a Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1273445.1273458)
 which describes a framework for effectively reading complex papers. 

```{note}
These papers rely on library access, more on how to use it is at the bottom of this page
```
 
Another good, less formal appraoch to the topic is [this how to article in Science](https://www.science.org/content/article/how-seriously-read-scientific-paper).

## Paper presentations

Thee goal of presenting a paper is to highlight the most important ideas and create room for discussion. 
We want all members of the group to understand the paper and to connect it to our own research. 

You may either share the paper itself or use slides, but either way the goal is not to read the paper but instead to 
help us (and yourself) understand it more deeply and to draw connections to our research. 

Highlight each of the following:
- Summary/main points
- Type of paper and methodology
- Key figures/ equations
- points of confusion
- weaknesses of the article
- your conclusion about the article

## Reference Management

While you are reading, you will accumulate a lot of papers.  It is best to
keep track of them using a a reference manager, for example [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).  
. Create an account and [request to join the lab's group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2869556/ml4sts). As you add papers to your library, add them to the appropriate projects group as well to share them with co-authors.

```{tip}
Set up  [google scholar to use the URI library](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_settings?oi=gsb&hl=en#2) so that you'll get better links to accessing paywalled papers
```

We write papers using LaTeX, which uses BibTeX for writing bibliographies, so
maintaining your read papers in BibTeX will make it easier when you start
preparing papers. Zotero can output a BibTeX and it can be imported directly to Overleaf. 

Install the [better BibTeX extension](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/) and [setting the citation key style](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/citing/#configurable-citekey-generators) to be `auth.lower + year + shorttitle(1,0)`.lower`.

Ways to get the BibTeX entry for a paper
  - from Google Scholar, click the cite button, then choose BibTeX.
  - add to a reference management software and fill in fields
  - follow the [BibTeX standard](http://www.bibtex.org/Format/) and write it manually

## URI Library Easy access

This [browser extension](https://www.leanlibrary.com/download/) is supported by the [URI Library](https://web.uri.edu/library/2020/12/17/library-access/).
